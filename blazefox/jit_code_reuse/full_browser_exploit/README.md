This exploit can be used on the full Firefox build shipped with the Blazefox challenge. It spawns a reverse shell to 127.0.0.1
on port 31337. Like the exploits for the Spidermonkey shell in this repository, it uses a JIT code reuse technique in order
to call <code>mprotect()</code> on some shellcode held in a TypedArray and then jumps to it, providing native code execution.
